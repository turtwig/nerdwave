        We keep your OpenID identifier from Google/Facebook et al. in order to

    We'd like to request less, but e.g. Google makes it impossible
    <i>not</i> to request your email address.

<h2>I don't like logging in via Google/Facebook!</h2>
<p>
    We refuse to ever be responsible for an email or password leak due to a bug
